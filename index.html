        <div class="item">A bit about me.<p>A little bit about myself, you see I'm not a millionaire or some rich dude that knows what he is doing. As a matter of fact, I just started with the whole investing concept, and it hasn't been easy. I thought all the videos on YouTube would help me, joining discords, and listening to podcasts. Truth is no one ever says how much you need to put in to even make a return, I’m not saying it’s impossible to work your money up, but it is time consuming and requires specific planning. I started investing a little bit after I got my first job, it wasn’t a lot, but I did make a big return my first year investing. Then I started playing with my money and that’s where I took a hit. I wanted more and I was very impatient so little by little my portfolio downsized. </p></div>
        <div class="item">Prior Knowledge<p>One of my biggest pet peeves is that I never learned about finances until I was out of school. The little we did learn wasn't enough to help with what I was supposed to do after high school. I worked and spent all the money I was making as a teen until my big brothers stepped in and gave me some advice and that was limit yourself to a certain amount a week and make it last till your next paycheck. To be completely honest it was the best advice I ever got. At this point I was getting a little better at saving more rather than spending the money I was making.</p></div>
        <div class="item">My loses.<p>Like I said in the beginning I made a bit of money my first year investing nothing crazy but for me It was the most I had ever made doing absolutely nothing, just pressing a button on the screen of my phone. I was living comfortably as a teen with my parents, making money working and my investments but everything good must come to an end and I was no exception. Like I said before I eventually got impatient and started bidding against the market. I wanted to carve my own way and got too greedy, and I lost. I had to pull most of my investments from cryptocurrency and stock market to cover my expenses. I sold almost everything I had in my portfolio except for my penny stocks.</p></div>
        <div class="item">Investments<p>I’m still learning to this day, and I’ve gained a bit of knowledge along the way with the mistakes I’ve made. Let me tell you the best thing you can do is avoid getting into debt while you’re young! I know some millionaires will say but debt is your best friend and that’s true but only when you know how to work the system to your advantage. If you feel like you want to invest but don’t know where to start, start with yourself.  </p></div>
        <div class="item">Income tips.<p>Some of the best income tips I know of include getting a credit card and building the credit up, but don’t go around spending more than what you’re making weekly. Open an LLC. I still haven’t figured that out. If you’re going to work, do it with great attitude and do something that makes you happy. Finally, work on yourself, improve anything you feel like you can do better. </p></div>
        <div class="item">Where I want to be in the future.<p>In the next couple of years, I plan on taking the next step to surpass where I am to where I want to be. It may take less or more time, but my patience has improved from what it was a couple of years ago. I’m no longer with my back against the wall. </p></div>
