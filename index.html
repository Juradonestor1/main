        <div class="item">Item 1<p>A little bit about myself, you see I'm not a millionare or some rich dude that knows what he is doing as a matter of fact I just started with the whole investing thing and it hasn't been easy. I thought all of the videos on youtube would help me, joining discords, and listening to podcasts. Truth is no one ever says how much you need to put in to even make a return. </p></div>
        <div class="item">Item 2<p>One of my biggest petpeeves is that I never learned about finaces until I was out of school. The little we did learn wasn't enough to help with what I was suppose to do.</p></div>
        <div class="item">Item 3<p>Skip through the menu, choose what you want to read or watch it's all really up to you.</p></div>
        <div class="item">Item 4<p>Knowledge is power</p></div>
        <div class="item">Item 5<p>Keep an open mind!!</p></div>
        <div class="item">Item 6<p>Don't rush into anything, take the time and learn first before you attemp anything. YOU COULD LOOSE A LOT OF MONEY!!!!!</p></div>
