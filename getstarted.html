    <h4>I know sometimes we think we don’t have money to start investing, I used to have that mindset too. That was until I realized I’m spending money that could be working for my future, I know you may think $5, $10 dollars isn’t enough to start but with everything available in this era you could buy your future with that kind of money if invested correctly. All you need to do is take that step forward and start your investment journey. Remeber if your dreams don't scare you, you're not dreaming big enough!!</h4>

            In the beginning everything will seem difficult, but it really isn’t once you have some understanding of everything that’s you’re looking at, whether it’s charts, graphs, or tables, it’ll become second nature. Even though it’s like second nature you need to practice, and you have practiced every so often, because everything that you don’t practice you will forget. Investing in anything is like a sport, the more you do it the easier it becomes.

            No matter where or what your money is going to, make sure you keep a diverse portfolio. Don’t just play in one place, let your money work for you and diversify throughout different places. In the long run it will help reduce risk and may lead to a higher return on our investment and assets.

            I've heard it multiple times, you need to have money to make money. It's true but you can always work your way up from nothig to something. I know we waste so much time deciding whether something will be worth it in the future, but sometimes we need to take a risk and hope for a better tomorrow. The best piece of advice I can give you is start, you have so much knowledge at the tip of your fingers (smartphones) that you can do anything now a days. Investing doesn’t have to be risky if you don’t feel comfortable doing it, find a company that’ll do it for you. Just Start, it’ll be the best decision you ever made in your life.
