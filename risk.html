            <h5 class="card-title">You need money to make money!</h5>
            <p class="card-text">As much as I hate to say this, but It's true. To be able to live comfortably for the rest of your life you need a nice sum of money in the initial investment. The reason being is the initial deposit that you make will be used to either collect interest or dividends depending on where you invest. The one thing that hurst people the most when they invest is that they don’t realize that the money they put in cannot be touched for a certain period. Hard working class will miscalculate their spending and their goes their dividends/interest when they have to pull the money out. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Not Everyone knows what they're talking about!</h5>
            <p class="card-text">This is where you must be cautious of who you watch or listen to when you’re planning to invest in anything. Most people make one good move, make a bit of money, next thing you know they’re trying to sell you a course on “I’ll teach you how to make money”.  </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">It's up to you!</h5>
            <p class="card-text">I love trying new things, but sometimes others’ opinions may vary from mine, and mine may vary with yours. So please do your own research before you put your hard-earned money anywhere near investors and brokers. If you’re married discuss it with your partner. I know I said you need money to make money, but you don’t need much to start in your investment journey look into buying stocks, cryptocurrency, something long term. Once you feel comfortable upgrade your investment and move on to the next thing on your mind. Don’t rush anything but don’t set it aside for tomorrow either. </p>
